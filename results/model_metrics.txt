Clinical Risk Model – Decision Tree (From GMR_Med_Error_Jan_21_to_Jul_24.ipynb)

Total medication error reports analyzed: 558

Model performance:
- Accuracy: 98.4%
- Recall (Critical/Severe outcomes): 94.4%

High-risk drivers identified:
- Dosing errors: primary driver of severe outcomes
- Ketamine: 90 events in the dataset
- Fentanyl: 6 events in the dataset
- Air branch: associated with ~67% of total reports and higher protocol deviation signal

Interpretation:
- The model strongly prioritizes catching high-risk events (high recall).
- Dosing errors and sedative/analgesic agents (Ketamine, Fentanyl) dominate the high-risk branches of the decision tree.
- Air operations appear more exposed to protocol drift and should be a focus for checklist simplification and targeted training.
